#Pull Request Dashboard
When working with a codebase that can span dozens of different code repositories, it can be difficult to keep track of the pull requests that you have created, or ones created by others that you may need to review.  This extension solves this issue by providing a place that pull requests across all repositories can be viewed on a single page.

##How to get to it?
This extension adds a new hub to the code section of Visual Studio Team Services/Team Found for viewing all active pull requests across all repositories.

##Features

###Pull Request Grouping
The hub queries for all active pull requests, and groups them into sevaral different categories.  Each grouping sorts pull requests, showing the oldest pull requests first.

* Requested by me - Pull requests requested by the current user
* Assigned to me - Pull requests created by another user that have the current user assigned as a reviewer
* Assigned to my team - Pull requests created by another user that have a team assigned as a reviewer that the current user is directly or indirectly a member of.
    * Inderect team membership means that a team that the current user is not a member of, but one of the teams that the user *is* a member of, is a member of the team (ex. User memberof Team1 memberof Team2).  This allows for pull requests assigned to "virtual" teams: a team made up of several other teams (ex. "UX Team" is made up of "UX Team 1" & "UX Team 2").
    * **Note**: Currently only supported for on-premises Team Foundation Server installations, due to APIs used that are currently unavailable in Visual Studio Team Services
* Other Open pull requests - All other active pull requests that don't fall into any of the above categories

###Pull Request Details
Each pull request displayed shows a number of useful pieces if information.

* PR Title & Author
* Repository name, from brach & to branch
* Merge conflicts - merge conflicts icon displayed only if the PR has merge conflicts.
* Reviewers
    * Each reviewer on the PR has an icon next to their name indicating their vote
        * Solid Circle Checkmark = Approved
        * Hollow Circle Checkmark = Approved With Suggestions
        * Yellow Circle Dash = Waiting for Author
        * Red Circle X = Rejected
    If a reviewer is marked as required on a PR, an asterisk is added next to their name (ex "User1*" indicates that User1 is a required reviewer on the PR)

###Filtering by Repository

![Filtering Repositories](assets/screenshots/repo_filter.png)

For an organization with dozens of different code repositories, an individual developer may only actively work in a handful of those repos, and may not care about PRs in other repos.  Next to the Other Pull Requests group header is a filter button that allows users to select just the repositories that they are interested in, and the Other Open Pull Requests category will dynamically update to show PRs only in repos selected.  Filter selections will be saved, allowing subesquent page loads to keep the user's filter selection.

###Settings

![Settings](assets/screenshots/settings.png)

At the top right of the dashboard plugin is a button which will drop down user-specific settings.  The settings supported are:

* Date Format - specifies the format to display PR creation date timestamps.  Default is "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm".
* All Projects - show pull requests from repositories across all projects.
