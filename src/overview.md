##TFS Pull Request Dashboard
When working with a codebase that can span dozens of different code repositories, it can be difficult to keep track of the pull requests that you have created, or ones created by others that you may need to review.

This extension adds a hub to the code section of tfs for viewing all active pull requests across all repositories.  Pull requests are grouped into the following categories:
* Requested by me
* Assigned to me
* Assigned to my team
    * Currently only supported for on-premises tfs
* Other Open pull requests
    * Allows filtering down to only repositories that you're interested in.  Useful for organizations with dozens of different code repositories, many of which a single given user may not be involved with.
